            I've been using computers since the Commodore PET, and programming since PASCAL was pretty hot stuff. I learned PASCAL first on my family's Apple ][+ with the RAM expansion to 64k! I graduated with a concentration in Computer Science from Kalamazoo College where I learned a variety of database skills along with the basic structure applicable to all programming languages. Learning how to 'think like a computer' has served me very well in everything I've done, from temping in offices to mixing feature films.

              I have rediscovered a love for computers that has been with me since my first experience at a computer drop-in. I'm working primarily in web app development (full stack) but am also looking to merge my audio post-production experience with coding.
